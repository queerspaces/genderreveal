<div id='text1'><a>
  ur breath has been playing carnival games
</a></div>

<div id='text2'><a>
  skipping stones in ur throat and now the old crisp packet is making fun of the way you hold your chest
</a></div>

<div id='text4'><a>
  maybe this time u will stop trying to “ground” something elusive in the sandpit of ur stomach
</a></div>

<div id='text5'><a>
  today the sun grips itself onto ur back and the mirror is covered in the same butterflies ur phone carries when texting ur crush
</a></div>

<div id='text6'><a href='https://queerspaces.github.io/field/' style="color:black">
  like the last time u called out ur name was just a fluke

  like u are finally getting a good look at urself

  u knit urself a new body so u are always touching something soft
